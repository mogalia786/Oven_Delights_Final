SELECT * FROM Retail_Stock WHERE BranchID = @BranchID;

SELECT * FROM InterBranchTransfers WHERE FromBranchID = @BranchID OR ToBranchID = @BranchID;
```

### **ItemType Correct:**
```sql

SELECT * FROM Products WHERE ItemType = 'External';

-- Manufactured products
SELECT * FROM Products WHERE ItemType = 'Manufactured';
```

### **Sync Working:**
```sql
-- After Complete Build, this should have records
SELECT * FROM Retail_Stock rs
INNER JOIN Retail_Variant rv ON rs.VariantID = rv.VariantID
INNER JOIN Products p ON rv.ProductID = p.ProductID
WHERE p.ItemType = 'Manufactured' AND rs.BranchID = @BranchID;
