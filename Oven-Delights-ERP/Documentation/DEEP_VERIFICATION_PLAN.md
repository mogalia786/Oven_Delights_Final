# DEEP VERIFICATION - 5 HOUR UNATTENDED SESSION

## ISSUE FOUND: Supplier Payment Form
**Claim:** Grid populates with outstanding invoices
**Reality:** Grid does NOT populate
**Root Cause Analysis Needed:**

### Possible Causes:
1. No data in SupplierInvoices table
2. BranchID filter too restrictive
3. AmountOutstanding column NULL or 0
4. Supplier not linked to invoices
5. Event handler not firing

### Fix Required:
- Add null checks
- Add data existence validation
- Add better error messages
- Test with actual data

## SYSTEMATIC VERIFICATION PROCESS

### Step 1: Verify Data Exists (SQL Queries)
For each feature claimed as working, verify:
1. Required tables exist ✅ (already done)
2. Required columns exist ✅ (already done)
3. **DATA EXISTS in tables** ❌ (NOT VERIFIED)
4. **Relationships work** ❌ (NOT VERIFIED)

### Step 2: Verify Form Initialization
For each form:
1. Constructor calls load methods
2. Event handlers wired correctly
3. Controls exist in Designer
4. No null reference exceptions

### Step 3: Verify Business Logic
For each feature:
1. Queries return data
2. Updates execute successfully
3. Ledger postings create records
4. Transactions commit

### Step 4: Test Each Claim
Go through EVERY checkmark in documentation and verify with:
- Code inspection
- Query testing
- Logic validation
