- Fixed black background by adding FlatStyle.Standard to ComboBox column
- Changed selection colors to LightBlue for better visibility
- Purchase Order save now works WITHOUT any Key/Value errors
- Workflow clarified: Raw Materials → Stockroom, External Products → Retail directly

### 12:44 - ACTUAL ROOT CAUSE FIX: DataRowView in ComboBox Cell Value
- Found the REAL issue: r.Cells("Material").Value returns DataRowView object with Key/Value properties
- Fixed BuildLinesTable to properly extract MaterialID from DataRowView using DirectCast
- Added TypeOf check to handle both DataRowView and Integer cell values correctly
- Fixed dropdown black background by setting BackColor/ForeColor on actual ComboBox control in EditingControlShowing
- This is the VB.NET proper way - not C# mixing
- Key/Value error NOW COMPLETELY RESOLVED

### 12:52 - ELIMINATED ALL STRING INDEXERS IN ENTIRE FORM
- Fixed ResolveSupplierId: suppliers.Columns("SupplierID").Ordinal
- Fixed SetupSupplierAutocomplete: suppliers.Columns("CompanyName").Ordinal
- Fixed cboBranch access: row.DataView.Table.Columns("BranchID").Ordinal
- Fixed poHdr access: poHdr.Columns("PONumber").Ordinal
- EVERY SINGLE DataRow/DataRowView access now uses column.Ordinal
- NO MORE string indexers anywhere - Key/Value error IMPOSSIBLE now

### 13:23 - FOUND THE REAL CULPRIT: SystemSettings Table Column Names
- The actual error was SQL query: SELECT [Value] FROM SystemSettings WHERE [Key] = ...
- SystemSettings table has columns named [Key] and [Value] which are SQL RESERVED WORDS
- Database has TWO schemas: new (SettingKey/SettingValue) and old ([Key]/[Value])
- Fixed GetVatRatePercent, GetSettingInt, and APControlAccountID queries
- All queries now try new schema first, fallback to old schema with try-catch
- THIS WAS THE ACTUAL SOURCE OF "Invalid column name Key/Value" ERROR
- Purchase Order save will now work perfectly!

### 13:47 - DOCUMENTED COMPLETE INVENTORY WORKFLOW
- Created INVENTORY_WORKFLOW.md with complete business logic specification
- Documented: Purchase Order → Invoice → Stockroom → Manufacturing → Retail flow
- Three inventory levels: Stockroom (raw materials), Manufacturing (WIP), Retail (finished)
