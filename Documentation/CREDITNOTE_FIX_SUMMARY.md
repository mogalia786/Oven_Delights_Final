# Credit Note System Fix Summary
**Date:** October 8, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## Issues Identified

### 1. ❌ Credit Notes Not Being Created
**Problem:** The `CreateCreditNote` method in `StockroomService.vb` was only returning a credit note ID - it wasn't actually inserting any records into the database.

**Impact:**
- Clicking "Create Credit Note" button did nothing
- No records in `CreditNotes` table
- No records in `CreditNoteLines` table
- Credit notes couldn't be tracked or processed

### 2. ❌ Missing Critical Fields in CreditNoteLines
**Problem:** The `CreditNoteLines` table was missing `ItemCode` and `ItemName` columns.

**Impact:**
- Even if credit notes were created, they wouldn't have product identification
- Reports couldn't display what items were credited
- Impossible to reconcile credit notes with inventory
- No way to identify products in credit note documents

---

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. ✅ Complete Credit Note Creation Implementation

**File:** `Services\StockroomService.vb`

**Changes Made:**
- Completely rewrote `CreateCreditNote` method (lines 3577-3629)
- Now properly inserts into `CreditNotes` table with all required fields:
  * CreditNoteNumber (auto-generated: CN-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS)
  * SupplierID
  * BranchID (multi-branch support)
  * CreditDate
  * RequestedDate
  * TotalAmount (calculated)
  * Status ("Pending")
  * Reason
  * Notes
  * CreatedBy
  * CreatedDate

- Now properly inserts into `CreditNoteLines` table with:
  * CreditNoteID (linked to header)
  * MaterialID
  * ItemType ("RM" for Raw Material)
  * **ItemCode** (retrieved from RawMaterials table)
  * **ItemName** (retrieved from RawMaterials table)
  * CreditQuantity
  * UnitCost
  * LineReason
  * CreatedBy
  * CreatedDate

- Uses proper transaction handling (commit/rollback)
- Includes error handling and logging

### 2. ✅ Database Schema Enhancement

**File:** `Database\Stockroom\Alter_CreditNoteLines_Add_ItemInfo.sql`

**Changes Made:**
- Added `ItemCode NVARCHAR(50)` column to `CreditNoteLines` table
- Added `ItemName NVARCHAR(200)` column to `CreditNoteLines` table
- Updated existing records with ItemCode and ItemName from RawMaterials table
- Updated existing records with ItemCode and ItemName from Products table
- Safe implementation (checks if columns exist before adding)

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Run Database Script
```sql
-- Execute this script first to add the new columns
Database\Stockroom\Alter_CreditNoteLines_Add_ItemInfo.sql
```

### 2. Test Credit Note Creation
1. Go to **Stockroom → Supply Invoices → Capture Invoice**
2. Select a supplier and purchase order
3. Enter received quantities less than ordered (to create shortage)
4. Click **Create Credit** button on a line with shortage
5. Confirm the credit note creation

### 3. Verify Database Records
```sql
-- Check CreditNotes table
SELECT * FROM CreditNotes ORDER BY CreatedDate DESC;

-- Check CreditNoteLines table with ItemCode and ItemName
SELECT 
    cnl.CreditNoteLineID,
    cn.CreditNoteNumber,
    cnl.ItemCode,           -- Should be populated
    cnl.ItemName,           -- Should be populated
    cnl.CreditQuantity,
    cnl.UnitCost,
    cnl.LineTotal
FROM CreditNoteLines cnl
INNER JOIN CreditNotes cn ON cnl.CreditNoteID = cn.CreditNoteID
ORDER BY cnl.CreatedDate DESC;
```

### 4. Expected Results
✅ Credit note header created in `CreditNotes` table  
✅ Credit note line created in `CreditNoteLines` table  
✅ `ItemCode` field populated with material code  
✅ `ItemName` field populated with material name
