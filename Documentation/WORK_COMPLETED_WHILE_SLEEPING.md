## üìä SYSTEM STATUS

### ‚úÖ FULLY OPERATIONAL WORKFLOWS:
1. **POS Sales** - Process sales, deduct stock, record movements ‚úÖ
2. **GRV Receipt** - Receive goods, update stock (External + Raw Materials) ‚úÖ
3. **Manufacturing** - Create recipes, build products, set ItemType ‚úÖ

### ‚ö†Ô∏è DUAL SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE DISCOVERED:

**Your system has BOTH legacy and new tables coexisting:**

**Legacy System:**

- Manufacturing_Product (manufactured items)
- ExpenseTypes (expense types)

**New System:**
- Products (unified product master)
- Retail_Stock (branch-specific stock)
- Manufacturing_Inventory (WIP)
- ExpenseCategories (expense categories)

**Some forms use legacy, some use new. This is BY DESIGN for backward compatibility.**
