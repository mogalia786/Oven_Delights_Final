## 📝 FILES TO RUN (IN ORDER)

### **Step 1: Database Schema**
```sql
-- File: COMPLETE_OVERNIGHT_FIXES.sql
-- Adds all missing columns and creates missing tables
-- Run time: ~30 seconds
```

### **Step 2: Test Data**
```sql
-- File: TEST_DATA_5_PRODUCTS.sql
-- Creates 5 products + suppliers + stock
-- Run time: ~10 seconds
```

### **Step 3: Verification**
```sql
-- Check products ready for POS
SELECT 
    p.ProductCode,
    p.ProductName,
    rv.Barcode,
    rp.SellingPrice,
    rs.QtyOnHand,
    b.BranchName
FROM Products p
INNER JOIN Retail_Variant rv ON p.ProductID = rv.ProductID
INNER JOIN Retail_Price rp ON p.ProductID = rp.ProductID AND rp.EffectiveTo IS NULL
INNER JOIN Retail_Stock rs ON rv.VariantID = rs.VariantID
INNER JOIN Branches b ON rs.BranchID = b.BranchID
WHERE p.ItemType = 'External'
ORDER BY p.ProductCode;
```

**Expected:** 5 products × number of branches

---

## ⚠️ MINOR ISSUES (Non-Blocking)

### **1. Black Dropdown Background**
- **Issue:** ComboBox in PurchaseOrderForm has black background
- **Impact:** LOW - Text still readable
- **Fix:** Override Theme.vb ComboBox BackColor
- **Priority:** LOW - Can fix during POS development

### **2. Branch Selector Missing in Stock Movement Report**
- **Issue:** Branch selector commented out (not in Designer)
- **Impact:** LOW - Uses session branch
- **Fix:** Add to Designer if multi-branch reporting needed
- **Priority:** LOW - Works for single branch
